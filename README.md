# AUTOMATED DOCKER DEPLOYEMENT

### PREREQUIST
- run this script in linux env
- have docker engine installed
- have some dev skills
  

### HOW ITS WORKS
This is an deployement automation with docker. 
Assuming your dev folders follow the same model in this exemple `./api/` `./front/` ELSE you can adjust the main script `container-launcher.sh`. 

This is thinked for postgres, redis, any front after build and nodeJS app.

It's my first bash script, so it's not perfect at all ! 

If you have any suggestion feel free to open an issue.
